## Introduction

**This library is currently in *alpha*, neither the functionality nor
the API is stable**

This library provides geospatial multispectral image support for fastai.
FastAI already has extensive support for RGB images in the pipeline. I
try to achieve feature parity for multi-spectral images with this
library, specifically in the context of Sentinel 2 geospatial imaging.

## Install

``` sh
pip install -Uqq fastgs
```

``` sh
conda install -c restlessronin fastgs
```

## How to use

The low-level functionality is wrapped into a class that loads sets of
Sentinel 2 channels into a multi-spectral tensor (a
[`TensorImageMS`](https://restlessronin.github.io/fastgs/vision.core.html#tensorimagems)
subclass of `fastai` `TensorImage` which itself is a subclass of the
`pytorch` `Tensor`).

``` python
from fastgs.geospatial.sentinel import *
```

The following code creates a class that can load 11 Sentinel 2 channels
into a
[`TensorImageMS`](https://restlessronin.github.io/fastgs/vision.core.html#tensorimagems).

``` python
from fastgs.vision.testio import * # defines read_multichan_files_as_tensor

sentinel2 = createSentinel2Descriptor()

snt_12 = MultiSpectral(
    sentinel2,
    ["B02","B03","B04","B05","B06","B07","B08","B8A","B11","B12","AOT"],
    "LC",
    [sentinel2.rgb_combo["natural_color"], ["B07","B06","B05"],["B12","B11","B8A"],["B08"]],
    get_channel_filenames,
    read_multichan_files,
    read_mask_file
)
```

The second parameter is a list of 4 channel sets that are minimally
required to visualize all the individual channels.

``` python
img_12 = snt_12.load_image(66)
img_12.show()
```
